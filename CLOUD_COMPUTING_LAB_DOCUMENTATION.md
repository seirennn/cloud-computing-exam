## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: State Management Complexity

**Problem**: Managing cart state across multiple components without prop drilling.

**Solution**: Implemented state management in the main page component and passed handlers as props. Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

**Learning**: Understanding component composition and state lifting in React.

### Challenge 2: Docker Build Optimization

**Problem**: Initial Docker build was slow and produced large images.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-stage build process with Alpine Linux base images. Separated dependency installation, build, and runtime stages.

**Learning**: Docker best practices for production deployments.

### Challenge 3: Cloud Deployment Configuration

**Problem**: Initial deployment failed due to incorrect build commands.

**Solution**: Configured Cloud Render to use Docker environment with automatic build detection. Set proper environment variables.

**Learning**: Understanding cloud platform deployment workflows and configuration.

### Challenge 4: Responsive Design

**Problem**: Layout breaking on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Implemented mobile-first CSS approach with media queries. Used flexible units (rem, %) instead of fixed pixels.

**Learning**: Responsive design principles and CSS Grid/Flexbox.

### Challenge 5: TypeScript Integration

**Problem**: Type errors during development.

**Solution**: Defined proper interfaces for all data structures. Used type inference where appropriate.

**Learning**: TypeScript benefits for large-scale applications.
